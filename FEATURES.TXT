Right now, we're going with manual creation of games and players.

Create a new game room, and go there.
@newgame name

Create a new player in the current game (room).
@newplayer name = password




Add option to allow name aliases?
This would have to happen at object creation.






Each game should be self-contained.  A game is defined by the
 object number of the room it's in.  All things, pokemon, and players
 associated with the game should have their game set to that room.  Any GM for
 that game can work on things from that game.


Per-game options:
Rename own pokemon
Set own descriptions?






Commands should not change behavior based on privelige.



Commands and abilities for each user level:

Ordinary users
